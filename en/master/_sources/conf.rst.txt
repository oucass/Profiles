Set-up: Configuration
=====================

After setting up either your file system or Azure to hold sensor coefficients, you'll need to edit "conf.py". This file will be located in the folder in which oucass-profiles was installed - if you're using Conda, it'll be something like "~/miniconda3/envs/MyEnv/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages/profiles/conf.py". Set the variables in this file so that your coefficients can be found.
